(3) **Which hormone is affected, when you deprive yourself of sleep?**

Chronic sleep deprivation can cause numerous mechanisms to go wrong inside the body. Studies have shown that as little as a week of sleep deprivation can cause significant alterations in glucose tolerance (i.e. how readily your body’s cells can recognize glucose floating around in your blood and pull it into the cells of the body where it will fuel activity). Impaired glucose tolerance can make you more likely to develop diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In fact, studies have shown that subjects who slept less than five to six hours per night were twice as likely to develop diabetes.

Sleep deprivation can also cause weight gain. Studies have shown the greatest risk for obesity to be when one gets two to fours hours of sleep per night, and the lowest BMI was associated with subjects who got an average of 7.7 hours of sleep per night. When your body doesn’t uptake glucose into the cell efficiently, you feel tired and hungry more often than you should, which makes you reach for more food, resulting in a calorie surplus. As your body is already not using energy (calories, and glucose well), they get stored away and you gain weight. 

### Leptin and Ghrelin
However, it is not just the glucose intolerance working against you. Sleep deprivation has been shown to lower leptin (an appetite-suppressing hormone produced by fat cells, which is normally produced in abundance at night) and increase ghrelin, (a hormone released by the stomach that stimulates hunger, which is also secreted at night but normally in lesser amounts). Research subjects were found to have an increased sense of hunger and tended to reach for carbohydrate-dense, sweet, and salty foods when sleep deprived.

### Cortisol
What is cortisol? It helps our bodies respond to stress appropriately so that we don’t become ill. People who do not produce adequate levels of cortisol are diagnosed with Addison’s disease and suffer from numerous problems. So, you need cortisol in the right amounts and at the right times. However, bedtime is not when you want your cortisol to be high as it heightens alertness.

Chronic sleep deprivation seems to mess cortisol secretion up. In studies on individuals who were sleep deprived (four hours of sleep per night), evening cortisol levels were elevated and the levels decreased six times slower when compared to control subjects. These elevations in cortisol further increase the likelihood of developing diabetes and obesity.
