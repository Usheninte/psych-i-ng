2. **What happens to the brain when 'babinsk reflex' occurs?**

The plantar reflex is a reflex elicited when the sole of the foot is stimulated with a blunt instrument. The reflex can take one of two forms. In normal adults, the plantar reflex causes a downward response of the hallux (flexion). An upward response (extension) of the hallux is known as the Babinski response or Babinski sign, named after the neurologist Joseph Babinski. The presence of the Babinski sign can identify disease of the spinal cord and brain in adults, and also exists as a primitive reflex in infants.

It has been understood that the plantar reflex involves more movements than just the toes. In most mammals, the limbs are automatically retracted to a painful stimulus. This defensive reflex is controlled by polysynaptic pathways of spinal cord. The reaction is more pronounced in the hind limbs, since the anterior ones are under more direct control of the brain . Not only the skin, but deeper structures have receptors that can generate this movement. The reflex effects on the human leg when stimulating the sole of the foot, are comparable to those of the animals.

Most infants and young children are not neurologically mature, so they show the Babinski reflex. Unlike older babies, flexion is much faster. The toes rise while giving ankle, knee and hip flexion.

As the pyramidal system matures and there is more control of the spinal motoneurons, changes in the flexion reflex are given. The most important change occurs after one or two years, and is that the fingers are no longer part of the synergy of flexion.

While another observed change is that the flexion reflex becomes less pronounced.

However, the neurophysiology of Babinski's reflex has not yet been fully understood. From studies Electromyographic , It is known that each skin zone appears to have a specific reflex response to noxious stimuli. The purpose of the reflex is to cause the removal of the skin from such a stimulus.

The area of ​​the skin from which the reflex can be obtained is called the reflex receptive field. Specifically, when there is a noxious stimulus in the sole of the foot (which would be a receptive field) the body reacts.

Immediate flexion of the toes, ankle, knee, and hip joints occurs to move away from the stimulus. This is what happens when we step on a sharp object with bare feet. There is an involuntary flexion of all joints and foot withdrawal.

Another normal reflex of the individual is the reflex of the big toe. Stimulation of the receptive field of the ball of the foot causes the extension of the finger, in addition to the flexion of the joints of the ankle, knee and hip.

The difference between these two types of reflexes is found in the receptive fields. It is the reason why in one the big toe flexes and in the other it extends.

What happens in Babinski's reflex is that there is an extension of the big toe when the wrong receptive field is stimulated. Thus, in front of a noxious stimulus on the sole of the foot, finger extension occurs instead of the normal flexion response.

As already explained, in newborns and infants up to two years of age, Central Nervous System Is not fully developed. In that way, there are parts of the corticospinal tract still Myelin (Layers that cover neurons and facilitate the transmission of information).

The corticospinal tract or Pyramidal path Are very long nervous axons. They originate in the cerebral cortex , Ranging from the Trunk of the brain To the spinal cord. The neurons of the corticospinal tract are known as" Motor neurons Superior".

The cortioespinal tract influences the reflex of the spinal cord. When the tract is not functioning properly, the receptive field of the reflex increases to encompass another distinct receptive field.

It seems that proper conservation of receptive fields depends on an intact cerebral cortex.

Abnormal Babinski's reflex may be the first indication of serious illness. Therefore, more detailed examinations should be carried out as a Computed tomography , or one magnetic resonance . And even a lumbar puncture to study the cerebrospinal fluid.
